        Mankind has developed superpowers known as "Quirks" this is the power the vast majority possesses,those who do not, are being 
        discriminated against and looked down on. Indeed, villains have the superpower, too and want to rebuild the world for it to 
        look the way they see it.However, a prestigious school known as the The Hero Academy trains its students for them to become
        heroes and to help those who have less powerful Quirks,or those who do not have them at all, as well as to stand against the plans 
        of the villains. The series focuses on a middle school student Izuku Midoriya,who has no superpowers. Will he be able to become 
        a hero and somehow to contribute to the peace and stability in the world, where the weak is the minority that needs to be defended.

            Deku received his power from All Might, the world’s strongest hero. One for All is a quirk that is 
            passed from one person to the next. It stock-piles the power, making it more potent as it continues 
            to be shared. It also holds the spirits of those before Midoriya. Meaning, he not only has a more 
            powerful version of the power than All Might, but he also has the quirks of every single user before 
            him. As the ninth user of One For All, Izuku Midoriya is one of the most powerful characters this series
             has ever seen!

            father. That means he can’t overheat or freeze himself. He can use both powers for ranged attacks, and with 
            more practice, he can become a tremendous close-range fighter like his father. He can freeze a building with 
            a wave of a hand or melt steel just thinking about it. Shoto Totoroki has the only quirk that is seemingly free 
            from weaknesses—making his quirk one of the strongest in the entire series.</p>

            massive explosions! He uses them to fly like Iron Man, makes more minor explosions in combat, and can even focus 
            on one area and makes a laser beam. Aside from some pushing himself too hard, nothing is stopping Bakugo or 
            holding him back. He is an unstoppable force.</p>

            most versatile characters in the series. This power is limitless and should come in handy in every situation 
            imaginable. She needs to store fat because her quirk uses lipids in her body, and she needs to know how to make
             every aspect of the item she’s creating. It takes a lot of skill to use Creation, but in the right hands, it’s 
             limitless.</p>

            different. The engines in his calves allow him to move at speeds faster than any other character in the 
            series so far. With his move, recipro turbo, he is virtually untouchable for 10 minutes straight!
             Though, if he goes too fast, he runs the risk of his engines stalling. That said, his average speed 
             is fast enough on most days.</p>

    <h2>
        <p style="color: aqua;">Dark Shadow can become one of the most powerful quirks in the My Hero Academia universe; because it 
            allows Tokoyami to control this shadow-like creature. It can see, talk, and fight alongside Tokoyami.
             He can also wear dark shadow as armor and even use it to fly! Like most characters, it has a major 
             weakness. He loses control in the dark, so dark shadow becomes a raging monster at night, and while
              it’s easier to control in the daylight, it isn’t nearly as strong. So, Tokoyami can never use Dark 
              Shadow to its fullest potential.</p>

             and durability. This means he’s nearly invincible, making him the perfect close combat fighter and 
             shield for teammates. He has shown he can take explosions and bullets without it having any effect on
              him. He’s able to go toe-to-toe with almost any opponent.</p>

            voltages of electricity. Allowing him to take down enemies, power up to support items or vehicles,
             and even shoot lightning bolts at specific targets (with a support item). Again, the problem is that

        <p style="color: aqua;">Being able to make anything you touch weightless has significant advantages. You can carry multiple 
            people during a rescue or can pick up large chunks of debris, and you can take down enemies if you’re 
            clever enough. The only drawback with Uraraka’s quirk is that she has to touch the person or item. 
            This means in combat; her quirk doesn’t help her unless she can strike first.</p>
